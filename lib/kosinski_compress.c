// Sega-accurate Kosinski compressor.
// Creates identical output to Sega's own compressor.

// Note that Sega's compressor was riddled with errors.
// Search 'Mistake' to find my reimplementations of them.

// Notably, Sega's compressor used the 'longest-match' algorithm.
// This doesn't give the best possible compression ratio, but it's fast,
// easy to implement, and can be done without loading the entire file into
// memory. The graph-theory-based algorithm Flamewing used might not have
// been feasible on late-80s PCs.

// Unfortunately, there's one bug I can't emulate: it seems the original
// compressor would accidentally read past the end of the uncompressed
// file, leading to the final match reading from an odd place in the
// dictionary. This would be because, instead of searching for 0FAE66,
// it would search for 0FAE6614 instead. Usually, the match has a 0 added
// to the end of it, but other times it's a different number entirely.

// Possible explanation for Mistake 5:

// "Hrm. I think I might have just figured out a quirk of Kosinski.

// I might just be talking out of my ass, but Kosinski has some reserved 'command'
// values: basically, if you try to do a long match with a length of 0, that marks
// the end of the file. Oddly enough, a long match with a length of 1 is also a
// reserved command, but it doesn't do anything.

// Notably, 1-length commands are inserted whenever the decompressed data so far
// passes 0xA000 bytes.

// At the time I didn't think much of it, but just earlier today I was being hassled
// by libsndfile. It's an audio decoder that doesn't have a function to give you the
// total decompressed size of the file. Likewise, Kosinski doesn't have a header to
// tell you that either.

// My problem with this was, I didn't know know big a buffer to allocate before
// calling libsndfile's decompressor. I eventually came up with the idea of allocating
// an 0x8000-byte buffer, and asking for a maximum of 0x8000 bytes. If I got 0x8000
// back, then I'd allocate another 0x8000-byte buffer, and ask for another 0x8000
// bytes, and so on.

// Kosinski decompression on the MD is notable because there's no bounds checking
// or anything. There's never a reserved Kosinski decompression buffer, and Sonic
// (obviously) doesn't use a memory allocation system. It just decompresses over the
// chunk table most of the time.

// So what if, the 1-length dummy command was actually for signalling to the original
// PC decompressor that its supposedly 0xA000-byte buffer wasn't gonna be big enough
// to hold the decompressed file, prompting it to allocate a larger buffer before
// continuing?"
